"detailed_description":"• What is coding? You might have seen the craze for learning code. But what exactly is coding? Coding is what makes it possible for us to create computer software, apps and websites. Your browser, your OS, the apps on your phone, Facebook, and this website – they’re all made with code. Here’s a simple example of code, written in the Python language: print 'Hello, world!' Many coding tutorials use that command as their very first example, because it’s one of the simplest examples of code you can have – it ‘prints’ (displays) the text ‘Hello, world!’ onto the screen. If you don’t know the first thing about coding, you’ve come to the right place. We’ve put together a beginner’s tutorial which will give you all the background information you need on coding, before you start learning it for real. It starts with an explanation on the benefits of learning coding. Here, you’ll find out what you’ll be able to do once you know how to work with code. Then, you’ll get a deeper understanding of how coding works, and how the code you write gets converted into an instruction that a computer can ‘understand’. Coding balances left and right brain, convergent and divergent thinking, to enable peak creative expression. You can learn logic and structure to command tech tools and generate outcomes like games and apps. • What is Scratch software/programming? Scratch Programming is language developed with the aim to ease the activity of writing programs for the purpose of building stories, creating animations and more. Scratch programming examples are primarily designed to target children starting from the age of 10 years and older, and was developed to teach people about computational thought process and how a simple language can be a powerful building-block towards the approach of coding skills which focuses more on developing a stable application rather than just syntaxes.

"value_proposition":"Early student years are the critical foundation for lifelong creative learning with current technology advancements, coding skills are becoming critical for all students. Students learn phonics, composition, and putting words together into composite stories. They also understand numbers, mathematical operations and units of measurements. Standardized learning systems keep logic and abstract streams discrete, eroding the developing mind’s ability for pattern recognition and discovery application. As a result, student’s creativity declines by 50% over a period of time. Coding combines logic & abstraction to set a lifelong foundation of integrating left & right concepts. Students use foundation of logic--sequence, loops, and commands--to create outcomes like puzzles & interactive stories, which enhances the outcome and expands creativity.",

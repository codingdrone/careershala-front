Activities would primarily be quizzes, case discussions and role plays. The queries can be raised in between the class via the learning platform, which can be resolved by the professor towards the end of the sessions in 10 minutes. Notes and references of the sessions will be shared with the participants. Notes will comprise of all important points throughout the session. The reference material will comprise of two parts-the theory part and the activities part. The theory part will comprise all the content on communication that is discussed by the instructor, whereas the activities part will consist of cases and role plays that will be scheduled for classes.</p>",

This course introduces you to practical data mining using the Weka workbench. We’ll dispel the mystery that surrounds the subject. We’ll explain the principles of popular algorithms. We’ll show you how to use them in practical applications. You’ll get plenty of experience actually mining data during the course, and afterwards you’ll be well equipped to mine your own.

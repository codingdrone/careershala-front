"requirements":"# Who is the course for?\nThis course is aimed at anyone who deals in data. It involves no computer programming, although you need some experience with using computers for everyday tasks. High school maths should be more than enough and you’ll need an understanding of some elementary statistics concepts (means and variances).\n  \n  \n\n# What software or tools do you need?\n\nYou will download the free Weka software during Week 1.

"overview":"\n#Learn how to mine your own data\n\nToday’s world generates more data than ever before! Being able to turn it into useful information is a key skill. This course introduces you to practical data mining using the Weka workbench. We’ll dispel the mystery that surrounds the subject. We’ll explain the principles of popular algorithms. We’ll show you how to use them in practical applications. You’ll get plenty of experience actually mining data during the course, and afterwards you’ll be well equipped to mine your own. Weka originated at the University of Waikato in NZ, and Ian Witten has authored a leading book on data mining.\n\n",
